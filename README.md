## General Information
This social media clone is my first solo project after completing my certificate at Lambda School! I have always wanted to create something with lots of functionality choices, so I felt that beginning my own social media clone would be a perfect route to take! Users may post text based 'posts' that can include a location, and an image (not yet functional). Users can follow other users, comments on other posts, and like posts. More functionality will be coming with time!

* React 16.12.0
* Redux 4.0.5
* react-router-dom 5.1.2
